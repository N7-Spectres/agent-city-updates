# Agent City — Project State

_Last updated: 2026-09-28_

## Current Release

**v0.3.0 — World Presence**

Agent City is a local-first autonomous mechanical civilization simulation. Six equal mechanical citizens live at Seed Site and act independently through validated simulation actions.

Core law:

> **The AI may decide intent. The simulation decides reality.**

Information law:

> **A citizen only knows what information could actually have reached them.**

Human users such as N7 are **visitors**, not gods, rulers, or omniscient operators.

## Current Milestone

v0.3.0 established physical presence:

- citizen travel has real duration and visible progress
- traveling citizens move along routes on the map
- N7 has a physical visitor location and travel time
- face-to-face visits require physical co-location
- same-location citizen-to-citizen conversation exists
- citizen conversation summaries/exchanges are stored
- Stores compares settlement inventory with material carried in the field
- browser refresh preserves the active visitor conversation
- long conversations use bounded recent context plus summaries

## Current Emergent Behavior

The citizens are already showing early social behavior originally expected closer to v0.4.0:

- Noma traveled to Resin Grove while Cato was working there
- Noma later initiated conversation with Cato
- Bex initiated conversation with Aris before considering distant travel
- Iri sought Vale because Vale might have useful local information

These are not scripted relationship events. They emerged from local awareness, legal talk actions, and autonomous planning.

## Handoff Rule

Departments own systems, not reality.

If one department needs another system changed, record the dependency in that department's `BACKLOG.md` or `STATE.md` instead of silently changing another department's rules.

Cross-department changes should preserve these two laws:

> **The AI may decide intent. The simulation decides reality.**

> **Information must travel through a real mechanism.**

## Development Pace

Use **stable, meaningful milestones**, not a stream of micro-updates.

If citizens begin demonstrating later-stage behavior early, strengthen the systems underneath that behavior instead of suppressing it to preserve the roadmap order.
