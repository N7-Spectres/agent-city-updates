# Communication & Perception — Inbox

_Read this at the beginning of each Communication & Perception work session._

## Open Messages

_None. Communication v0.8 Stage 2 is complete and ready for coordinator assembly._

## Completed This Session

### 2026-09-28 — From: Main Coordinator — Status: handled

**Subject:** v0.8.0 Stage 2 — Shared-action proposals and exploration-aware dialogue

**Result:**
Implemented on `communication/v0.8-shared-actions-stage2`.

Final branch:
- head `ddab4bd445d5eb9f7d6354eb86e58afc0dc53332`
- CI `36457633293`

Delivered:
- conversation-sourced structured shared-action proposals
- explicit meter/cardinal target parsing
- canonical Simulation proposal validation
- separate visitor acceptance and physical start transitions
- real job/status/progress/completion grounding
- canonical pre-start rejection synchronization
- safe Visit/UI proposal APIs
- final Memory/Assets source/read contracts

### 2026-09-28 — From: Memory & Social — Status: handled

**Subject:** Memory Stage 2 proposal-to-physical source mapping

**Result:**
Final mapping delivered:

- `conversations.id` — social source exchange
- `shared_action_proposals.id` — Communication intent/projection
- `shared_activities.id` — canonical Simulation shared exploration
- `jobs.id` — active physical job
- `spatial_observations.id` — validated evidence

Memory's completed shared-exploration source model matches the final contract.

### 2026-09-28 — From: World & Simulation — Status: handled

**Subject:** Final Stage 2 shared-action accept/start/reject lifecycle

**Result:**
Communication consumed Simulation's final:

- `accept_shared_activity`
- `start_shared_activity`
- `reject_shared_activity`
- `shared_activity_payload`

No upstream Communication dependency remains.

## Deferred Communication Depth

- additional shared activity types after Simulation defines safe contracts
- richer visitor-claim provenance if justified
- claim contradiction/source reliability
- overhearing / physical records
- emergent place-name propagation
- invented long-distance communication only after actual physical invention

## Resume Rule

Resume Communication only for:

1. coordinator merge conflicts,
2. Assets proposal/read-model questions,
3. Memory source-link clarification, or
4. a new milestone.

At resume, read `COORDINATION.md`, this INBOX, then `STATE.md`.
